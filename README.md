LD25Submission
==============

Ludum Dare 25 submission I did back in 2012, kinda lame game I should fix it up some day.

Mojobojo 2012

The aim was an RTS space game where you invade or destroy planets based off the LD25 theme "You are are Villain".
I didn't get everything I wanted in, but definitely enough to make a game that's not too boring hopefully.
I used OpenGl through LWJGL and Java.

Planets are random, the names can get a little funky because they are random as well.

Remember to install the Java 7 runtime

Controls:

W - S - A - D: movement
Q: switch planet in menu
E: view stats
Z: destroy planet
X: invade planet
C: view planet info
M: view map
P: pause
SPACEBAR: increase speed

Tips:
Try to go with planets where you have a better chances to score first so you dont
sit there waiting to destroy or invade a planet for a long time.

Use the mini map to show you where you are in space and to see what planet is being
taken back.

Use the boost!

Bugs:
I tried my best to avoid them, but a 48 hour game is bound to have them.
This has only been tested in windows.
